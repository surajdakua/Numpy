# Numpy
Numpy for Data Science and Machine Learning

## Why you need Numpy?
 	- Since, Python does not have built-in support for Arrays. Numpy is used to create multi-dimensional array (2D, 3D.. N-D array) inorder to acheive this Numpy must be used for ML and Data Science enthusiasts.

### Benefits of using Numpy for Data Science/ML?
	1. To know the dimension of the array whether it's is 2-D, 3-D or N-D.
	2. To know the size of an array
	3. To know the shape of an array
	4. To convert 1-D array to 2-D or vice-versa.
	5. To create matrix such as identity matrix, diagonal matrix, ones matrix, zeros matrix etc.
	6. Change the value in an array, reverse a array, or perform mathematical operation such as addition,
	   subtraction etc of the matrix.
	7. Perform matrix multiplication or dot product of two matrix.
	8. Find min, max, argmin, argmax, median, std, transpose of array. 
	9. Find the sin, cos, logarithmic, exponential etc of array.
	10. Also reduces the computation time of the program.
